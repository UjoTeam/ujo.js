Ujo is a music platform that uses the ethereum blockchain as the substrate for innovation by empowering artists, digitizing their music rights and metadata, sharing this information in an open and decentralized environment, thus enabling new applications, products, and services to license their catalogs and pay artists directly with minimal friction. You can learn more about the protocol [here](https://blog.ujomusic.com/the-ujo-platform-a-decentralized-music-ecosystem-e530c31b62bc).

This repo contains a JavaScript package for interacting with Connext's State Channels, a layer 2 technology meant for decreaing the load on the Ethereum network.

## Background

This package provides connection points to Connext's payment channel hub with funds denominated in Dai. Much of the functionality seen in the [dai wallet](https://daicard.io/) is obfuscated into a simple package. To read more on Connext visit [their docs](https://github.com/ConnextProject/docs/wiki).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is beta software. Use at your own discretion.

## Getting Started

To get started, npm or yarn install the package and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save @ujoteam/card
// or
yarn add @ujoteam/card
```

You will need to point to a hub in order to utilize the state channel functionality. Connext currently hosts hubs for both the Rinkeby and Ethereum Mainnet. If you would like to run your own node, check out [their docs for indra](https://github.com/ConnextProject/indra).

First create a new Card by passing in an object with the properties seen in the javascript below. The `onStateUpdate` function is a callback which will be called every time the state of the address is updated. State is updated by sending, receiving, depositing, or withdrawing funds. The only argument currently passed to the callback is the amount denominated in wei. A helper function is provided to convert to USD: `convertDaiToUSDString`.

```js
const card = new Card({
  hubUrl: 'https://...',
  rpcProvider: 'https://...',
  onStateUpdate: amnt => { console.log(`$${card.convertDaiToUSDString(amnt)}`)},
  domain: 'localhost [for connext debugging purposes]',
});
```

Initializing the card with require a `hubUrl` and json `rpcProvider`. If running indra locally, you can leave these values blank or remove them from the object as the default values will point to the local hub running on port 8080 and the rpc provider on 8545. Otherwise, options for rinkeby and mainnet are respectively:

```js
// rinkeby
const CONNEXT_HUB_URL = "https://daicard.io/api/rinkeby/hub";
const CONNEXT_RPC_URL = "https://eth-rinkeby.alchemyapi.io/jsonrpc/SU-VoQIQnzxwTrccH4tfjrQRTCrNiX6w";

// mainnet
const CONNEXT_HUB_URL = "https://daicard.io/api/mainnet/hub";
const CONNEXT_RPC_URL = "https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/jsonrpc/rHT6GXtmGtMxV66Bvv8aXLOUc6lp0m_-";
```

Then 

```js
const address = await card.init(mnemonicCanGoHere);
```

If an mnemonic is not passed in to the init function, one will be generated for you. However, it will first check if any mnemonic had previously been stored in localStorage first.

**Important**
Upon initialization, a mnemonic will be generated and stored in localStorage keyed at `localStorage.get('mnemonic')`. For this reason you should warn your users to avoid resetting localStorage as it will result in the disappearance of the mnemonic and therefore a generation of a new seed phrase and wallet next time the Card is initialized.

## Using the Card

The card offers out of the box functionality for handling deposits. Utilizing another wallet holding either ether or dai, send a deposit to the wallet address returned from the `card.initialize` function as seen in the getting started section. It may take some time for the hub to receive the deposit request and collateralize your channel.

Once funds have appeared in your wallet, there are three main activites to perform:

- Direct Payment (to another wallet, non-custodial)
  - `card.generatePayment(valueAsNumberToSendInUSD, walletAddressAsString)`
- Pay via Link (custodial)
  - `const linkToClaim = await card.generateRedeemableLink(valueAsNumberToSendInUSD)`
- Claim via Link
  - `card.redeemPayment(linkToClaim)`
- Withdraw funds
  - `card.withdrawalAllFunds(walletAddressAsString)`
